Introduction
============
This user manual explains how to install and use CYMDISTToFMU.
CYMDISTToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows 
users to export the distribution simulation program `CYMDIST <http://www.cyme.com>`_ version 7.2 
or as a :term:`Functional Mock-up Unit` (FMU) for co-simulation 
using the :term:`Functional Mock-up Interface` (FMI) 
standard `version 2.0 <https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v2.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_and_CoSimulation_v2.0.pdf>`_.
This FMU can then be imported into a variety of simulation programs 
that support the import of the Functional Mock-up Interface for co-simulation.
